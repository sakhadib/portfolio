### I am a student of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Islamic University of Technology, currently completing my BSc. in Software Engineering. I have a keen interest in both frontend and backend development, and enjoy working on projects that allow me to exercise both skill sets. In my free time, I like to explore the intersection of technology and science, and often engage in writing and reading about these topics. Additionally, I am passionate about digital art and enjoy creating visual content that communicates my ideas effectively.
